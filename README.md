**Description**: Our metric is based on the best neighborhood to be Spider-Man. Our submetrics are based on training, need for a superhero, and practicality for Spider-Mans abilities. The data sets we used were based on the number of playgrounds for training, number of arrests and incident reports for the need category, and the building height for practicality. What we did was take the top 10 neighborhoods for each submetric, and average them out to figure out which places highest overall. Here are the links to our data sets: <br>

**Overview**: Our repository has the 4 data sets and 3 individual notebooks for the submetrics, a readme, and a final report.
