**Introduction**: <br>
    Our project is to find the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on an arbitrary metric. Our approach was to take a look at where it would be best to be Spider-Man. We wanted something fun that would look into many otherwise unrelated data sets and explore the potential that there could be a real correlation between them. We thought about some others such as the best place to becoem the next Jeff Bezos, etc but we landed on this one because we decided we liked the sub-metrics the best and thought it would be more fun than the others.
**The Metric**: <br>
    The features that we decided on included a place to train, ability to swing around effectively, and the general need for a superhero. When diving deeper into these metrics, we decided that for training, the number of playgrounds would be best as they are abundant and a great place for your friendly neighorhood spiderman to practice acrobatics as well as web slinging. For ability to swing, we decided on building height, because Spider-Man can't work at his peak without high buildings to swing off of and climb to beat the bad guys. Finally, for the general need, we looked at the number of arrests and incidents, because in order for there to be a need, there needs to be crime happening for Spider-Man to stop.

**Conclusion**: <br>
    Connor: The data driven determination is quite different from my personal neighborhood, and understandably so. The metrics looked at here are radically different than what personally matters to me. As just a regular person, I prefer the number of stores, places to eat, population, etc rather than metrics that matter for a superhero. I'd also argue that I would run the opposite way of the "best neighborhood to be Spider-Man", as it has one of the highest incident and arrest rates, which is not what I would want for *my* neighborhood.
