**Introduction**: <br>
    Our project is to find the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on an arbitrary metric. Our approach was to take a look at where it would be best to be Spider-Man. We wanted something fun that would look into many otherwise unrelated data sets and explore the potential that there could be a real correlation between them. We thought about some others such as the best place to becoem the next Jeff Bezos, etc but we landed on this one because we decided we liked the sub-metrics the best and thought it would be more fun than the others.
**The Metric**: <br>
    The features that we decided on included a place to train, ability to swing around effectively, and the general need for a superhero. When diving deeper into these metrics, we decided that for training, the number of playgrounds would be best as they are abundant and a great place for your friendly neighorhood spiderman to practice acrobatics as well as web slinging. For ability to swing, we decided on building height, because Spider-Man can't work at his peak without high buildings to swing off of and climb to beat the bad guys. Finally, for the general need, we looked at the number of arrests and incidents, because in order for there to be a need, there needs to be crime happening for Spider-Man to stop.
**The Best Neighborhood**: <br>
    Squirrel Hill South
**Conclusion**: <br>
    Connor: The data driven determination is actually the same as my favorite neighborhood. I haven't actually been to Squirrel Hill yet but I hear there's really good food there and it seems like a really fun neighborhood to live in. Looking at my own data sets I was actually surprised that the overall ended up being Squirrel Hill. I didn't actually know it was a part of my top 10 until we brought all the data together.
    Ansel: The data led us to Squirrel Hill South which matches up with what my personal preference would be. I am not from Pittsburgh so the main thing I am considering is how the neighborhood looks and I liked the way that Squirrel Hill South looked so that was the obvious choice for me. 
    Riley: This data was a little surprising to me. From looking at my data there were other neighborhoods that came before it and I was expecting downtown to really be the best neighborhood in out project. I am not from Pittsburgh but I was expecting the city to be the place that needed Spider Man the most.
