    "    My approach to the metric is to look at arrests and incident reports. You can't have a Spider-Man without people to save and crimes to stop. In order to do that I used two data sets. I looked at incident reports in the last 30 days and the number of arrests since 2016 and found the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest in both metrics. I was thinking about looking into the inverse with highest incidents lowest arrests but I found it was a very hard metric to find and since the incidents were last 30 days and arrests were last 7 years it would be almost impossible to find an accurate and definitive winner for this sub-metric."
